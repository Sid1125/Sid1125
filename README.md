## 💼 Key Projects

### 🔹 [AgentRecon](https://github.com/Sid1125/AgentRecon)

A **modular AI-assisted reconnaissance pipeline** for cybersecurity assessments. Combines traditional security scanning tools with modern LLM-driven orchestration to automate and enrich port scanning, vulnerability discovery, CVE enrichment, false positive filtering, and more.

**Features:**

* Dockerized scanning stack (Nmap, Nikto, SSLyze, Gobuster, WhatWeb)
* CVE enrichment using AlienVault OTX + NVD APIs
* LangGraph agent orchestrating modules using natural language
* False positive filtering via AI
* Markdown + JSON log outputs
* Web-based UI using OpenWebUI (Ollama)

### 🔹 Project SENTINEL *(Full Stack AI-Powered SOC Suite)*

A comprehensive **Security Operations Center (SOC)** solution integrating traditional scanning, threat detection, and automated incident response powered by AI.

**Modules:**

* Recon and vulnerability assessment (Nmap + OpenVAS)
* CVE enrichment and threat intelligence lookups (AlienVault, AbuseIPDB, NVD)
* ML and LLM-based threat detection using Random Forest, SVM, DL, GPT/BERT
* Explainability (SHAP, LIME)
* Reinforcement learning-based adaptive defense
* Honeypots (Cowrie, Dionaea)
* Blockchain-based logging for audit trails
* Compliance Engine (NIST, ISO, HIPAA)
* Plugin system + lightweight endpoint agents (like osquery)

### 🔹 Project SENTINEL: Omega Protocol *(Work in Progress)*

An **AI-powered autonomous red team** that:

* Scans, simulates MITRE ATT\&CK behaviors using Caldera & Atomic Red Team
* Records findings, severity levels, CVSS scores, and remediation
* Generates detailed VAPT reports in markdown/PDF
* Integrates honeypots (Cowrie, Dionaea), blockchain-based audit logs, and AI explainability (SHAP, LIME)

### 🔹 [Discord Bot - Dr FUSED](https://github.com/Sid1125/DrFUSED)

* Multifunctional bot for server management, entertainment, and automation.
* Built using **Discord.js**, integrated with APIs, and scalable for communities.
* Includes moderation, games, utilities, and music—designed with user safety in mind.

### 🔹 [Tic-Tac-Toe with AI](https://github.com/Sid1125/PRODIGY_WD_03)

* Web-based game using Minimax algorithm for unbeatable AI.
* Clean UI, dark mode, and extra features for enhanced UX.

### 🔹 [Student DB Management System](https://github.com/Sid1125/LibraryManagementSystem)

* GUI-based library database using Python and MySQL.
* Focused on secure CRUD operations and structured data flow.

### 🔹 [Personal Portfolio](https://sid1125.github.io/portfolio/)

* Showcasing my projects, skills, and experience in a sleek, responsive layout.
